  abstract  = {Saaty (1977-1983) presents an eigenvector (EV) procedure for
               analyzing matrices of subjective estimates of the utility of one
               entity relative to another. The procedure is an especially
               effective tool for analyzing hierarchical problems where the
               dependence of the entities at one level on the entities in
               adjacent levels is estimated subjectively. Despite the absence of
               a formal proof that the procedure has desirable qualities as an
               estimator of the underlying relative utilities, the process has
               gained an active following. This paper derives a comparable
               estimate, the geometric mean (GM) vector (also known as the
               logarithmic least squares method or LLSM), that can be applied to
               hierarchical problems in exactly the same way but is developed
               from statistical considerations. It is shown to be optimal when
               the judge's errors are multiplicative with a lognormal
               distribution. The GM shares the desirable qualities of the EV and
               is preferable to it in several important respects.},

  abstract  = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate a method of scaling
               ratios using the principal eigenvector of a positive pairwise
               comparison matrix. Consistency of the matrix data is defined and
               measured by an expression involving the average of the
               nonprincipal eigenvalues. We show that λmax = n is a necessary
               and sufficient condition for consistency. We also show that twice
               this measure is the variance in judgmental errors. A scale of
               numbers from 1 to 9 is introduced together with a discussion of
               how it compares with other scales. To illustrate the theory, it
               is then applied to some examples for which the answer is known,
               offering the opportunity for validating the approach. The
               discussion is then extended to multiple criterion decision making
               by formally introducing the notion of a hierarchy, investigating
               some properties of hierarchies, and applying the eigenvalue
               approach to scaling complex problems structured hierarchically to
               obtain a unidimensional composite vector for scaling the elements
               falling in any single level of the hierarchy. A brief discussion
               is also included regarding how the hierarchy serves as a useful
               tool for decomposing a large-scale problem, in order to make
               measurement possible despite the now-classical observation that
               the mind is limited to 7 ± 2 factors for simultaneous comparison.},

               the normal distributions, certain hypotheses are proposed that
               lead to k necessarily being exactly 4. More specifically, by
               using the moments of the second and fourth orders, it is shown
               that the usual beta distribution in the PERT method is mesokurtic
               (γ=3) and of constant variance (σ2=136).},

               specifically, we analyze the impact of market price, marketing

               prices can serve as a coordination mechanism in a supply chain
               setting; integrating alternative supplier pricing policies within
               the newsvendor framework; and how the buyer’s risk profile
               moderates the newsvendor order quantity decision. For each of
