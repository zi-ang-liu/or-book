  abstract  = {Saaty (1977-1983) presents an eigenvector (EV) procedure for
               analyzing matrices of subjective estimates of the utility of one
               entity relative to another. The procedure is an especially
               effective tool for analyzing hierarchical problems where the
               dependence of the entities at one level on the entities in
               adjacent levels is estimated subjectively. Despite the absence of
               a formal proof that the procedure has desirable qualities as an
               estimator of the underlying relative utilities, the process has
               gained an active following. This paper derives a comparable
               estimate, the geometric mean (GM) vector (also known as the
               logarithmic least squares method or LLSM), that can be applied to
               hierarchical problems in exactly the same way but is developed
               from statistical considerations. It is shown to be optimal when
               the judge's errors are multiplicative with a lognormal
               distribution. The GM shares the desirable qualities of the EV and
               is preferable to it in several important respects.},

               considered. This mean involves a parameter k, that sometimes has
               been set to 4. Insisting on the similarity between the beta and
               the normal distributions, certain hypotheses are proposed that
               lead to k necessarily being exactly 4. More specifically, by
               using the moments of the second and fourth orders, it is shown
               that the usual beta distribution in the PERT method is mesokurtic
               (γ=3) and of constant variance (σ2=136).},

               customer demand, supplier costs, and the buyer risk profile. More
               specifically, we analyze the impact of market price, marketing
               effort, and stocking quantity on customer demand; how supplier
               prices can serve as a coordination mechanism in a supply chain
               setting; integrating alternative supplier pricing policies within
               the newsvendor framework; and how the buyer’s risk profile
               moderates the newsvendor order quantity decision. For each of
               these areas, we summarize the current literature and develop
               extensions. Finally, we also propose directions for future
               research.},
